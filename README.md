## About this project

This project is a mere Application Prototyping attempt to deploy the same instance of the WebApplication built off of React JS into different Cloud Server Platforms.

## What kind of Web Application?

**Reference of the templates:**

- (Dashboard)
  - (Django) https://django-dashboard-shards.appseed.us/
  - (React) https://coreui.io/react/
- (Login Page) Custom Built
  - https://codesandbox.io/s/wizardly-elion-urnnn
- (Landing Page)
  - https://inovatik.com/evolo-free-startup-landing-page-template.html

## Cloud Server Platforms

- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine)
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) - EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)

## Development Milestones

1. Setup Create React App (~5mins)
2. Include Landing Page Template (~20mins)
3. Setup React Routing (~10mins)
4. Include Dashboard Template (~30mins)
5. Setup Authentication with Higher-Order Components (HOC) (~15mins)
6. Deploy (~60mins)

In total we expect the total delivery time, comprised in all of the aforementioned steps, to take approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to prepare the base instance of the Web App that gets replicated. Additionally, for each cloud server, we expect to utilize about 1 hour to setup the configuration and deployment steps.

## Development Strategy

Each cloud server deployment configuration files will be compartmentalized into individual branches off of the same Repository. For Example:

- **Github Pages:** digimarket/gh-pages
- **Heroku:** digimarket/heroku
- **NextJS:** digimarket/nextjs
- **GCP App Engine:** digimarket/gcp-appengine
- **AWS EC2:** digimarket/aws-ec2
